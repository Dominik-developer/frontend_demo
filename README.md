# rove s2 project

I rawdodge all this this morning

Folder structure: (mac version)
/Users/your_username/Desktop/project/
├── public/     <-- frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)
└── api/

HOW TO USE:

In both api & fronedn folders are text files on how to run every part (they were created for mac so on widows they may not work [API part, frontend works the same])

ADVICE:

The best way to open it is via vscode and via option: open github repository

You can also download form github repo page via download zip button and then move the folder to dekstop

INSTRUCTIONS:

* DO NOT change folder structrure.
